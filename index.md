I am a graduate student in the Astronomy department at The University of Texas at Austin. I work with Professor Adam Kraus on direct imaging of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets. I received my B.A. in physics and computer science from Wesleyan University in 2014 and my M.A. in astronomy in 2015 as part of Wesleyan's 5 year combined BA/MA program. 

For more information on my research intrest and projects, see my [research](/research) page. For a list of my publications, presentations and my full CV, see my [publications](/publications) page. 
My [blog](/blog) has my ramblings on random cool science tidbits or coding projects (currently just reposts of my [astrobites](https://astrobites.org/author/sfactor/) articles).
