I am a highly motivated and independent researcher seeking to transition into industry. I aim to leverage broad expertise in space-based observational techniques, novel image processing algorithms, statistical data analysis, physical modeling, and lab experience acquired through a Ph.D. in Astronomy. I learn quickly and can apply and communicate new knowledge efficiently and effectively.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the astronomy department at The University of Texas at Austin. My research, with Professor Adam Kraus, focuses on using a novel image analysis technique called kernel-phase interferometry to directly image brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets. This technique uses self-calibrating observables to remove errors in the wavefront of light caused by interactions within the telescope. This allows me to detect companions below the classical $$ \lambda/D $$ diffraction limit. I apply this technique to imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and JWST to detect companions to low mass stars at separations below the classical diffraction limit. 

I recently received my Ph.D. in astronomy from The University of Texas at Austin in 2023. Previously, I received my B.A. in physics and computer science from Wesleyan University in 2014 and my M.A. in astronomy in 2015 as part of Wesleyan's 5 year combined BA/MA program.

For more information on my research intrest and projects, see my [research](/research) page. For a list of my publications, presentations and my resume/CV, see my [publications](/publications) page. 
My [blog](/blog) has my ramblings on random cool science tidbits or coding projects (currently just reposts of my [astrobites](https://astrobites.org/author/sfactor/) articles).
