I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Astronomy department at The University of Texas at Austin. I work with Professor Adam Kraus on direct imaging of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets using a novel image analysis technique called kernel-phase interferometry. I apply this technique to imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and JWST to detect companions to low mass stars at separations below the classical diffraction limit. 

I recently received my Ph.D. in astronomy from The University of Texas at Austin in 2023. Previously, I received my B.A. in physics and computer science from Wesleyan University in 2014 and my M.A. in astronomy in 2015 as part of Wesleyan's 5 year combined BA/MA program.

My [blog](/blog) has my ramblings on random cool science tidbits or coding projects (currently just reposts of my [astrobites](https://astrobites.org/author/sfactor/) articles).
