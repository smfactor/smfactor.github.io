Here are links to my industry [resume](/assets/pubs/resume.pdf) and my accademic [CV](/assets/pubs/CV.pdf).

My peer reviewed publications and presentations are listed below. For more information see my publications on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/qPvFlClMRy6j1c9XXvvrLw) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z2CCopsAAAAJ&hl=en).

You can find videos of my public outreach talks at Astronomy on Tap, Austin TX on the [about me](/aboutme) page.

I was a staff writer for astrobites.org in 2018-2019, you can find my paper summaries [here](https://astrobites.org/author/sfactor/). You can also see my answers on [askanastronomer.org](http://askanastronomer.org/byauthor/?author=Sam+Factor).
