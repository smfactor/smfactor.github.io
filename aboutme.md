Check out an interview I did with the Wesleyan Newsletter [here](http://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2015/05/19/samfactor/).

I help organize Astronomy on Tap ATX, a monthly free public event presenting astronomy talks in a bar. Here are my talks from December 2017 and July 2019:

I enjoy hiking and camping in what little free time I have. I also dabble in astrophotography. Below are a few pictures I took. (More to come, including pictures of the recent solar eclipse from Grand Teton National Park!)

I caught the International Space Station transiting the sun just north of Austin, TX on the morning of November 4, 2018.

## Rowing

In High School, at Camp Randall Rowing Club, and in college, at Wesleyan University, I rowed competitively. In my Junior and Senior year of college I sat stroke seat of the 2nd Varsity 8+ at the New England Rowing Championships where we finished 3rd both years. Also in my senior year I sat 2 seat of our 1st varsity 8+ at the Head of the Charles Regatta and finished 5th in the Collegiate 8+ event. In high school I traveled to US Rowing Youth National championships 3 years in a row to compete in the light weight 4+ event. My junior year we finished 4th in the nation.
